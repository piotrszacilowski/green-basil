Hi my name is Piotr!

I'm computer science student based in Poland. I'm interested in technology and everything in its orbit.

My main goal is to become a professional programmer and on this blog I would like to share my career path.

At the moment, my main area of study is backend like Java and Springboot. I'm familiar with frontend too.

Besides, I love running and sleeping.
